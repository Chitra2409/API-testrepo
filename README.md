# Website Overview

This website is a simple content management system (CMS) for managing articles. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete articles. The primary purpose of the website is to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Docker.

## Technology Stack

The website is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side scripting.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing article data.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into a container, making it easy to deploy and run across different environments.

The website showcases how to build a RESTful API using Express and interact with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations on articles. Additionally, it includes a Dockerfile for containerization, allowing the application to be easily deployed in a containerized environment.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the API endpoints to understand how this technology stack is used to build a basic content management system.
